# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature creates a definitive performance benchmark that answers the critical question: "When should I choose Reducto Mode 3 over existing compression formats?" The system generates realistic datasets, measures end-to-end performance across multiple dimensions, and produces actionable insights for compression format selection in production environments.

**Success Metric**: Enable users to make data-driven compression format decisions within 5 minutes of running the benchmark.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Real-World Dataset Collection

**User Story:** As a developer evaluating compression for production workloads, I need test data from actual real-world sources that naturally exhibit the redundancy patterns where differential compression excels, so that benchmark results accurately predict performance on my data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run the data collector THEN the system SHALL fetch 100MB of real-world data from public APIs and repositories, split into 5 files of exactly 20MB each
2. WHEN collecting high-redundancy data THEN the system SHALL download GitHub repository contents (multiple versions of similar projects), Stack Overflow question dumps, and Wikipedia article collections where content naturally repeats across files
3. WHEN gathering medium-redundancy data THEN the system SHALL collect open-source codebases from GitHub API (Rust, JavaScript, Python projects) that share common patterns, imports, and boilerplate code
4. WHEN obtaining structured data THEN the system SHALL fetch JSON datasets from public APIs (OpenWeather, JSONPlaceholder, GitHub API responses) that contain repeated field names and similar value patterns
5. WHEN collecting log-like data THEN the system SHALL download real server logs, CSV datasets from data.gov, or similar structured data with natural repetition patterns
6. WHEN APIs are unavailable THEN the system SHALL fall back to cached sample datasets that represent the same real-world patterns
7. WHEN data collection completes THEN the system SHALL analyze and report the redundancy characteristics of collected data, showing why this data would benefit from differential compression

**Real-World Data Sources:**
- GitHub API: Repository contents, commit diffs, issue discussions
- Stack Overflow Data Dump: Questions, answers, comments (XML format)
- Wikipedia Dumps: Article content with natural cross-references
- Public JSON APIs: Weather data, geographic data, social media APIs
- Open Government Data: CSV files with repeated structures
- Docker Hub: Dockerfile collections with common base patterns

### Requirement 2: Production-Focused Performance Measurement

**User Story:** As a system architect choosing compression for production deployment, I need to understand the real-world trade-offs between compression ratio, speed, and resource usage, so that I can optimize for my specific constraints (storage cost vs CPU cost vs latency requirements).

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run compression benchmarks THEN the system SHALL test the 4 most relevant formats: Reducto Mode 3, gzip (ubiquitous), zstd (modern standard), and 7z (maximum compression) 
2. WHEN measuring compression effectiveness THEN the system SHALL calculate space savings percentage and bytes saved per second to show real economic impact
3. WHEN recording performance THEN the system SHALL measure wall-clock time (user experience), CPU time (cost), and peak memory (resource planning)
4. WHEN testing Reducto Mode 3 THEN the system SHALL build reference corpus from 30% of test data and include corpus build time in total cost analysis
5. WHEN comparing formats THEN the system SHALL use production-realistic settings: gzip level 6, zstd level 3, 7z default, Reducto optimized for 4KB blocks
6. WHEN measuring reliability THEN the system SHALL run each test 3 times and fail if results vary by more than 5% (ensuring consistent, trustworthy results)
7. WHEN benchmarks complete THEN the system SHALL identify the optimal format for 3 key scenarios: minimize storage cost, minimize latency, minimize CPU usage

### Requirement 3: End-to-End Cycle Validation

**User Story:** As an application developer, I need to understand the complete cost of compression including decompression speed and reliability, so that I can evaluate the total user experience impact of each format choice.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run decompression benchmarks THEN the system SHALL measure decompression speed and verify 100% data integrity for all formats
2. WHEN measuring decompression performance THEN the system SHALL record throughput in MB/s to enable direct comparison with network and disk speeds
3. WHEN testing decompression THEN the system SHALL measure memory efficiency (peak memory / file size ratio) to assess resource scaling
4. WHEN validating integrity THEN the system SHALL use cryptographic hashing (BLAKE3) for fast, reliable verification rather than byte-by-byte comparison
5. WHEN decompressing with Reducto Mode 3 THEN the system SHALL measure corpus access patterns and memory-mapping efficiency
6. WHEN any decompression fails THEN the system SHALL immediately halt testing and report the failure as a critical reliability issue
7. WHEN decompression testing completes THEN the system SHALL calculate total round-trip efficiency (original size / (compression time + decompression time))

### Requirement 4: Decision-Driving Analysis

**User Story:** As a technical decision maker, I need clear recommendations for when to use each compression format, so that I can make optimal choices without becoming a compression expert.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analysis completes THEN the system SHALL output 3 clear recommendations: "Best for storage optimization", "Best for speed", and "Best for balanced performance"
2. WHEN calculating trade-offs THEN the system SHALL compute cost-effectiveness metrics: storage cost saved per CPU second, and latency cost per space saved
3. WHEN evaluating Reducto Mode 3 THEN the system SHALL determine the minimum dataset size where differential compression becomes advantageous
4. WHEN analyzing by redundancy pattern THEN the system SHALL identify which formats excel for high-redundancy vs low-redundancy data
5. WHEN computing efficiency THEN the system SHALL calculate "break-even points" where compression overhead is justified by storage/transfer savings
6. WHEN generating insights THEN the system SHALL identify scenarios where Reducto Mode 3 provides >20% advantage over alternatives
7. WHEN analysis fails to find clear winners THEN the system SHALL report "no significant difference" rather than forcing artificial rankings

### Requirement 5: Executive-Ready Visual Summary

**User Story:** As a technical leader presenting to stakeholders, I need a single, compelling visual that clearly shows when and why to choose Reducto Mode 3, so that I can make the business case for adoption or explain why alternatives are better.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating the visual report THEN the system SHALL create one primary Mermaid diagram that answers "Which format should I use?" at a glance
2. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL use a decision-tree style visualization showing format recommendations based on data characteristics and constraints
3. WHEN showing performance data THEN the system SHALL highlight only the most significant differences (>15% improvement) to avoid overwhelming detail
4. WHEN presenting Reducto Mode 3 results THEN the system SHALL clearly show its "sweet spot" scenarios and when it's not the optimal choice
5. WHEN creating the diagram THEN the system SHALL include quantified business impact: "Saves X% storage cost" or "Reduces latency by Y ms"
6. WHEN visualizing trade-offs THEN the system SHALL use intuitive metaphors (storage cost vs speed) rather than technical metrics
7. WHEN the diagram is complete THEN it SHALL be immediately usable in README documentation and technical presentations without additional explanation

### Requirement 6: One-Command Benchmark Execution

**User Story:** As any developer evaluating Reducto, I want to run `cargo run --bin benchmark` and get definitive results in under 5 minutes, so that I can quickly determine if Reducto fits my use case without complex setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `cargo run --bin benchmark` THEN the system SHALL complete all testing and generate the final report in under 300 seconds on a standard development machine
2. WHEN executing benchmarks THEN the system SHALL show a progress bar with estimated time remaining and current operation
3. WHEN any compression tool is missing THEN the system SHALL automatically skip that format and continue, noting the absence in the final report
4. WHEN benchmarks complete THEN the system SHALL output the Mermaid diagram directly to stdout and save detailed results to `benchmark_results.md`
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL continue testing other formats and clearly report what failed and why
6. WHEN running on CI/CD THEN the system SHALL support a `--quick` mode that completes in under 60 seconds with reduced dataset size
7. WHEN benchmark finishes THEN the system SHALL display a one-line summary: "Reducto Mode 3 recommended for [scenario] with X% advantage" or "Alternative format recommended"

### Requirement 7: Real-World Corpus Strategy

**User Story:** As a user evaluating differential compression for production deployment, I need the system to build reference corpora from realistic shared knowledge bases, so that Reducto Mode 3 is tested under conditions that mirror how organizations would actually deploy it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building reference corpus THEN the system SHALL create corpora from common base datasets: popular GitHub repositories (like React, Node.js), common documentation patterns, and standard library references
2. WHEN creating corpus for code data THEN the system SHALL use the most-starred repositories in each language as corpus material, since these represent common patterns developers reuse
3. WHEN building corpus for structured data THEN the system SHALL use schema definitions, API documentation, and common JSON/XML templates that appear across multiple datasets
4. WHEN testing corpus effectiveness THEN the system SHALL measure compression improvement when the corpus represents "shared organizational knowledge" vs random data samples
5. WHEN corpus provides less than 15% advantage over standard compression THEN the system SHALL identify this as a scenario where differential compression isn't worthwhile
6. WHEN analyzing real-world deployment THEN the system SHALL calculate corpus maintenance costs (storage, updates) vs compression benefits to show total cost of ownership
7. WHEN corpus strategy succeeds THEN the system SHALL provide specific recommendations: "Use Reducto Mode 3 when you have >X MB of data sharing patterns with Y type of reference corpus"

**Realistic Corpus Scenarios:**
- Software Development: Common frameworks, standard libraries, boilerplate code
- Documentation: Style guides, templates, repeated content structures  
- Data Processing: Schema definitions, API responses, configuration files
- Content Management: Article templates, repeated content blocks
- DevOps: Configuration files, deployment scripts, infrastructure as code

### Requirement 8: Production Deployment Simulation

**User Story:** As a system architect planning production deployment, I need to understand how Reducto Mode 3 performs in realistic organizational scenarios where teams share common codebases, templates, and data patterns, so that I can accurately estimate the benefits for my specific use case.

2. WHEN testing documentation workflows THEN the system SHALL compress collections of technical documentation that share templates, style guides, and repeated content structures
3. WHEN evaluating data processing pipelines THEN the system SHALL test compression of API responses, configuration files, and data exports that share common schemas and field patterns
4. WHEN measuring organizational benefits THEN the system SHALL calculate potential storage savings for realistic data volumes: "If your team has 1GB of similar code/docs/data, expect X% savings"
5. WHEN testing corpus sharing scenarios THEN the system SHALL measure performance when multiple teams could share the same reference corpus vs maintaining separate corpora
6. WHEN analyzing deployment complexity THEN the system SHALL factor in corpus distribution, versioning, and maintenance costs in the final recommendations
7. WHEN simulation completes THEN the system SHALL provide specific deployment guidance: "Reducto Mode 3 recommended for organizations with >X developers sharing Y types of content"
