# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature creates a **dead-simple benchmark** that answers ONE critical question: **"Will Reducto Mode 3 save me storage/bandwidth costs on MY data?"**

The system tests the user's actual data (or generates realistic samples), compares Reducto Mode 3 against gzip (the universal baseline), and gives a clear YES/NO recommendation with quantified savings.

**Success Metric**: User runs `cargo run --bin benchmark [my-data-directory]` and gets a definitive answer in under 60 seconds.

**Anti-Goals**: 
- Complex multi-format comparisons (gzip is the only baseline that matters)
- Elaborate visualizations (simple text output is sufficient)
- Organizational deployment simulation (premature - prove value first)

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: User Data Analysis

**User Story:** As a developer with actual data files, I want to test Reducto Mode 3 on MY data, so that I know if it will save me money in my specific use case.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `cargo run --bin benchmark /path/to/my/data` THEN the system SHALL analyze all files in that directory up to 100MB total
2. WHEN I don't provide a data path THEN the system SHALL generate 20MB of realistic test data representing common scenarios: source code, JSON logs, and documentation
3. WHEN analyzing my data THEN the system SHALL identify redundancy patterns and predict if differential compression will be effective
4. WHEN my data has low redundancy THEN the system SHALL immediately report "Reducto Mode 3 not recommended for this data type" and exit
5. WHEN my data shows promise THEN the system SHALL proceed with compression testing
6. WHEN data analysis completes THEN the system SHALL output: "Data analysis: X% redundancy detected, proceeding with compression test"

### Requirement 2: Head-to-Head Compression Test

**User Story:** As a developer evaluating compression options, I need to see if Reducto Mode 3 beats gzip on my data, so that I can make a simple go/no-go decision.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running compression tests THEN the system SHALL test only 2 formats: Reducto Mode 3 vs gzip (the universal baseline)
2. WHEN measuring effectiveness THEN the system SHALL calculate compression ratio and compression speed for both formats
3. WHEN testing Reducto Mode 3 THEN the system SHALL build a reference corpus from 30% of the data and include corpus build time in total time
4. WHEN testing gzip THEN the system SHALL use level 6 (production default)
5. WHEN tests complete THEN the system SHALL determine the winner based on: better compression ratio AND reasonable speed (not >10x slower)
6. WHEN Reducto wins THEN the system SHALL report: "Reducto Mode 3: X% better compression, Y% speed difference"
7. WHEN gzip wins THEN the system SHALL report: "Stick with gzip: Reducto provides insufficient benefit"

### Requirement 3: End-to-End Cycle Validation

**User Story:** As an application developer, I need to understand the complete cost of compression including decompression speed and reliability, so that I can evaluate the total user experience impact of each format choice.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run decompression benchmarks THEN the system SHALL measure decompression speed and verify 100% data integrity for all formats
2. WHEN measuring decompression performance THEN the system SHALL record throughput in MB/s to enable direct comparison with network and disk speeds
3. WHEN testing decompression THEN the system SHALL measure memory efficiency (peak memory / file size ratio) to assess resource scaling
4. WHEN validating integrity THEN the system SHALL use cryptographic hashing (BLAKE3) for fast, reliable verification rather than byte-by-byte comparison
5. WHEN decompressing with Reducto Mode 3 THEN the system SHALL measure corpus access patterns and memory-mapping efficiency
6. WHEN any decompression fails THEN the system SHALL immediately halt testing and report the failure as a critical reliability issue
7. WHEN decompression testing completes THEN the system SHALL calculate total round-trip efficiency (original size / (compression time + decompression time))

### Requirement 4: Decision-Driving Analysis

**User Story:** As a technical decision maker, I need clear recommendations for when to use each compression format, so that I can make optimal choices without becoming a compression expert.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analysis completes THEN the system SHALL output 3 clear recommendations: "Best for storage optimization", "Best for speed", and "Best for balanced performance"
2. WHEN calculating trade-offs THEN the system SHALL compute cost-effectiveness metrics: storage cost saved per CPU second, and latency cost per space saved
3. WHEN evaluating Reducto Mode 3 THEN the system SHALL determine the minimum dataset size where differential compression becomes advantageous
4. WHEN analyzing by redundancy pattern THEN the system SHALL identify which formats excel for high-redundancy vs low-redundancy data
5. WHEN computing efficiency THEN the system SHALL calculate "break-even points" where compression overhead is justified by storage/transfer savings
6. WHEN generating insights THEN the system SHALL identify scenarios where Reducto Mode 3 provides >20% advantage over alternatives
7. WHEN analysis fails to find clear winners THEN the system SHALL report "no significant difference" rather than forcing artificial rankings

### Requirement 5: Executive-Ready Visual Summary

**User Story:** As a technical leader presenting to stakeholders, I need a single, compelling visual that clearly shows when and why to choose Reducto Mode 3, so that I can make the business case for adoption or explain why alternatives are better.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating the visual report THEN the system SHALL create one primary Mermaid diagram that answers "Which format should I use?" at a glance
2. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL use a decision-tree style visualization showing format recommendations based on data characteristics and constraints
3. WHEN showing performance data THEN the system SHALL highlight only the most significant differences (>15% improvement) to avoid overwhelming detail
4. WHEN presenting Reducto Mode 3 results THEN the system SHALL clearly show its "sweet spot" scenarios and when it's not the optimal choice
5. WHEN creating the diagram THEN the system SHALL include quantified business impact: "Saves X% storage cost" or "Reduces latency by Y ms"
6. WHEN visualizing trade-offs THEN the system SHALL use intuitive metaphors (storage cost vs speed) rather than technical metrics
7. WHEN the diagram is complete THEN it SHALL be immediately usable in README documentation and technical presentations without additional explanation

### Requirement 6: One-Command Benchmark Execution

**User Story:** As any developer evaluating Reducto, I want to run `cargo run --bin benchmark` and get definitive results in under 5 minutes, so that I can quickly determine if Reducto fits my use case without complex setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `cargo run --bin benchmark` THEN the system SHALL complete all testing and generate the final report in under 300 seconds on a standard development machine
2. WHEN executing benchmarks THEN the system SHALL show a progress bar with estimated time remaining and current operation
3. WHEN any compression tool is missing THEN the system SHALL automatically skip that format and continue, noting the absence in the final report
4. WHEN benchmarks complete THEN the system SHALL output the Mermaid diagram directly to stdout and save detailed results to `benchmark_results.md`
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL continue testing other formats and clearly report what failed and why
6. WHEN running on CI/CD THEN the system SHALL support a `--quick` mode that completes in under 60 seconds with reduced dataset size
7. WHEN benchmark finishes THEN the system SHALL display a one-line summary: "Reducto Mode 3 recommended for [scenario] with X% advantage" or "Alternative format recommended"

### Requirement 7: Real-World Corpus Strategy

**User Story:** As a user evaluating differential compression for production deployment, I need the system to build reference corpora from realistic shared knowledge bases, so that Reducto Mode 3 is tested under conditions that mirror how organizations would actually deploy it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building reference corpus THEN the system SHALL create corpora from common base datasets: popular GitHub repositories (like React, Node.js), common documentation patterns, and standard library references
2. WHEN creating corpus for code data THEN the system SHALL use the most-starred repositories in each language as corpus material, since these represent common patterns developers reuse
3. WHEN building corpus for structured data THEN the system SHALL use schema definitions, API documentation, and common JSON/XML templates that appear across multiple datasets
4. WHEN testing corpus effectiveness THEN the system SHALL measure compression improvement when the corpus represents "shared organizational knowledge" vs random data samples
5. WHEN corpus provides less than 15% advantage over standard compression THEN the system SHALL identify this as a scenario where differential compression isn't worthwhile
6. WHEN analyzing real-world deployment THEN the system SHALL calculate corpus maintenance costs (storage, updates) vs compression benefits to show total cost of ownership
7. WHEN corpus strategy succeeds THEN the system SHALL provide specific recommendations: "Use Reducto Mode 3 when you have >X MB of data sharing patterns with Y type of reference corpus"

**Realistic Corpus Scenarios:**
- Software Development: Common frameworks, standard libraries, boilerplate code
- Documentation: Style guides, templates, repeated content structures  
- Data Processing: Schema definitions, API responses, configuration files
- Content Management: Article templates, repeated content blocks
- DevOps: Configuration files, deployment scripts, infrastructure as code

### Requirement 8: Production Deployment Simulation

**User Story:** As a system architect planning production deployment, I need to understand how Reducto Mode 3 performs in realistic organizational scenarios where teams share common codebases, templates, and data patterns, so that I can accurately estimate the benefits for my specific use case.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN simulating software development teams THEN the system SHALL test compression of multiple projects that share common dependencies, frameworks, and coding patterns (e.g., multiple React apps, multiple Rust CLI tools)
2. WHEN testing documentation workflows THEN the system SHALL compress collections of technical documentation that share templates, style guides, and repeated content structures
3. WHEN evaluating data processing pipelines THEN the system SHALL test compression of API responses, configuration files, and data exports that share common schemas and field patterns
4. WHEN measuring organizational benefits THEN the system SHALL calculate potential storage savings for realistic data volumes: "If your team has 1GB of similar code/docs/data, expect X% savings"
5. WHEN testing corpus sharing scenarios THEN the system SHALL measure performance when multiple teams could share the same reference corpus vs maintaining separate corpora
6. WHEN analyzing deployment complexity THEN the system SHALL factor in corpus distribution, versioning, and maintenance costs in the final recommendations
7. WHEN simulation completes THEN the system SHALL provide specific deployment guidance: "Reducto Mode 3 recommended for organizations with >X developers sharing Y types of content"
