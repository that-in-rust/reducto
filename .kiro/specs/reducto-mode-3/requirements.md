# Product Requirements Document: Reducto Mode 3

## Executive Summary

Reducto Mode 3 (Differential Synchronization) is a strategic data logistics platform designed to eliminate redundant data storage and transfer costs in enterprise environments. By leveraging managed Reference Corpora (RC), Reducto achieves 10x-100x improvements in transfer speeds and storage efficiency for high-redundancy datasets such as VM images, CI/CD artifacts, and database backups. It transforms the economics of data management by ensuring that unique data is transferred only once across an organization's infrastructure.

## Product Vision

We are not in the compression business. We are in the **data logistics** business. The value of Reducto isn't smaller files; it's the radical reduction of time and cost required to move data at enterprise scale.

### North Star Metrics
- **End-to-End Transfer Time Reduction (E2ETTR)**: Primary success metric measuring total time savings
- **Corpus Hit Rate (CHR)**: Key diagnostic metric indicating reference corpus effectiveness
- **Economic Impact**: Quantified cost savings in storage and bandwidth

## Target Market & Use Cases

### Primary Use Cases
1. **VM Image Distribution**: Daily OS updates and patches across enterprise infrastructure
2. **CI/CD Artifact Management**: Build artifacts and container images in development pipelines
3. **Database Backup Optimization**: Incremental backup systems with high data overlap

### Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)
- Enterprise organizations with high data redundancy (>70% overlap between datasets)
- DevOps teams managing frequent deployments across multiple environments
- Organizations with bandwidth constraints or high data transfer costs

## Strategic Requirements

### Requirement 1: Robust Differential Compression via Content-Defined Chunking

3. WHEN configuring the system THEN users SHALL be able to set expected average chunk size (4KB-64KB) to optimize for different data types
4. WHEN chunks are identified THEN the system SHALL maintain chunk size variance within acceptable bounds (50%-200% of target size)
5. WHEN processing completes THEN fixed-size blocking SHALL be explicitly prohibited to prevent boundary shift failures

### Requirement 2: Reference Corpus Lifecycle Management

4. WHEN analyzing datasets THEN the system SHALL provide corpus optimization recommendations based on block frequency analysis
5. WHEN distributing corpora THEN the system SHALL support versioning, pruning of stale blocks, and integrity verification

### Requirement 3: Intelligent Rolling Hash with Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want the chunking algorithm to efficiently process large datasets, so that compression throughput meets enterprise SLA requirements.

### Requirement 4: Ecosystem-Aware Decompression with Cold Start Resolution

**User Story:** As an end-user updating software, I want the update process to automatically handle finding necessary reference data, so updates complete reliably without manual intervention.
#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting decompression THEN the system SHALL validate required RC Version GUID from file header
2. WHEN required RC is unavailable locally THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic fetching from configured repositories
3. WHEN RC access is slow or unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide graceful degradation to standard compression
4. WHEN decompression completes THEN output SHALL be verified against end-to-end cryptographic hash stored in header
5. WHEN corpus distribution fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback options

### Requirement 5: Advanced Serialization with Secondary Compression

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the compressed output to be optimized for both storage and network transmission, so that infrastructure costs are minimized across the entire data pipeline.
#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN serializing instructions THEN the system SHALL use efficient binary serialization (bincode or equivalent)
2. WHEN finalizing output THEN the system SHALL apply Zstandard compression at configurable levels (1-22)
3. WHEN creating headers THEN the system SHALL include magic bytes, corpus version GUID, chunk parameters, and integrity hashes

5. WHEN streaming is required THEN the system SHALL support progressive compression without requiring complete input buffering

### Requirement 6: Scalable Memory Management and Corpus Access

**User Story:** As a platform engineer, I want to handle reference corpora of any size efficiently, so that the system scales to enterprise datasets without memory constraints.
#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing large corpora THEN the system SHALL use memory mapping with intelligent caching strategies
